# Supervised-learning-algorithms
Some of the supervised learning algorithms.

Supervised learning problems can be further grouped into regression and classification problems.

1-Classification: A classification problem is when the output variable is a category, such as “red” or “blue” or “disease” and “no disease”.
2-Regression: A regression problem is when the output variable is a real value, such as “dollars” or “weight”.

In this repository we have the following classification examples:
1-Naive Bayes
2-KNN- K Nearest neignbour
3-Decision trees

and the following regression examples:
1-Simple linear regression
2-Multiple regression
3-Logistic regression
